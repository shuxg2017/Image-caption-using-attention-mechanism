# Image Caption With Attention
**In this project, we built a neural network model which can describe an image. (more details below)**

- We trained with 50k images and 250k captions. (5 captions/image)
- Data source: http://cocodataset.org/#download
- Due to the size of the model, it is not able to be uploaded on this site :(
- Model structure
  - InceptionV3 pre-trained model
  - Feature map encoder
  - Attention
  - Decoder

### Model Prediction
- **The title on the image below is the caption generated by the model.**

- **Attention maps: the dark and bright areas correspond how much they contribute when a specific word is generated.**
